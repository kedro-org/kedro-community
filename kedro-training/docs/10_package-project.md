# Distributing a project

In this part of the training, you will learn how to distribute your data project.

## Add documentation to your project

While Kedro documentation can be found by running `kedro docs` from the command line, project-specific documentation can be generated by running `kedro build-docs` in the project's root directory.

This will create documentation based on the code structure of your project. Documentation will also include the [`docstrings`](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python) defined in the project code. The resulting HTML files can be found in `docs/build/html/`.

`kedro build-docs` uses the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) framework to build your project documentation, so if you want to customise it, please refer to `docs/source/conf.py` and the [corresponding section](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) of the Sphinx documentation.

>Note: If you would like to open your documentation from the CLI then you need to run `kedro build-docs --open`.

## Package your project

Once a project is ready, most people just use the Python package without further editing it. In this case, the package can be conveniently installed in a single line of code. Kedro can automatically generate egg (`.egg`) and wheel (`.whl`) files for your package.

To do this, run `kedro package` from the command line, which will create the wheel and egg artefacts and save them to `src/dist/`. For further information about packaging for Python, documentation is provided [here](https://packaging.python.org/overview/).

## Manage dependencies

Ensuring that you have accounted for all Python package versions that your project relies on encourages reproducibility of your Kedro project. Use the `kedro build-reqs` CLI command to pin package versions. It works by taking a `requirements.in` file (or `requirements.txt` if the first one does not exist), resolving all package versions using [pip compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#example-usage-for-pip-compile) and _freezing_ them by putting pinned versions back into `requirements.txt`. It significantly reduces the chances of dependencies issues due to downstream changes as you would always install the same package versions using `kedro install`.

## Extend your project

- You can also check out [Kedro-Docker](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-docker), an officially supported Kedro plugin for packaging and shipping Kedro projects within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

- We also support converting your Kedro project into an Airflow project with the [Kedro-Airflow](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-airflow) plugin.
