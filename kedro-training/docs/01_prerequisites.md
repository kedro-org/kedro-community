# Installation prerequisites

Kedro supports macOS, Linux and Windows (7 / 8 / 10 and Windows Server 2016+). If you encounter any problems on these platforms please engage Kedro community support on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kedro).

## Python

Kedro supports Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (Python 3.7 version) to install Python packages. However, if Anaconda is not preferred then this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) can help you with installation and setup.

### `PySpark`

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) will need to be installed if `PySpark` is a workflow requirement.

> _Note:_ Windows users will require admin rights to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Optional tools

### Git
Git is a version control software that records changes to a file or set of files. Git is especially helpful for software developers as it allows changes to be tracked (including who and when) when working on a project.

To download `git`, go to the following link and choose the correct version for your operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

#### Windows
Download the [`git` for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/). Make sure to select **Use `git` from the Windows command prompt** this will ensure that `git` is permanently added to your PATH.

Also select **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings** selected and click on **Next**.

This will provide you both `git` and `git bash`. We might have a few exercises using the command line quite a lot during the workshop so using `git bash` is a good option.

### GitHub
GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. You will need to set up an account at: https://github.com.

Basic GitHub accounts are free and you can now also have private repositories.

### Text editors & IDEs
Text editors are tools with powerful features designed to optimize writing code. There are many text editors that you can choose from. Here are some we recommend:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Docker
Docker is a tool that makes it easier to create, deploy and run applications. It uses containers to package an application along with its dependencies and then runs the application in an isolated virtualised environment.

If Docker is a tool that you use internally then make sure to carefully read the prerequisites and instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/install/.
