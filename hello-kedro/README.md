# Hello Kedro Example

This is the example code described in the [Hello Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/private-kedro/blob/develop/docs/source/02_getting_started/04_hello_kedro.md) documentation. 

<!-- NOTE: LINK TO CHANGE SHORTLY -->

As is traditional for "Hello World" projects, it is a very simplistic example to introduce the most basic elements of a Kedro project within a small amount of code.
