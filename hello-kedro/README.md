# Hello Kedro Example

This is the example code described in the [Hello Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/02_get_started/04_hello_kedro.md) documentation. 

As is traditional for "Hello World" projects, it is a very simplistic example to introduce the most basic elements of a Kedro project within a small amount of code.
