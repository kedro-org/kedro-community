# What is `kedro-examples`?

This repo contains example code to help you learn how to use [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro).

## How do I use it?

Each example has an README.md that explains what each project does and how to work with it.

## What will I find in this repository?

- We recommend starting with [`kedro-tutorial`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/master/kedro-tutorial), which is the complete version of the [Space Flights tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.html) described in the Kedro [documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) and includes the data necessary to run the project. Some of the old code examples are available in the following links:

  - [Kedro 0.14.0](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.14.0)
  - [Kedro 0.15.0](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.0)
  - [Kedro 0.15.5](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.5)
  - [Kedro 0.15.8](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.8)

- Documentation that you can use to deliver Kedro training in [`kedro-training`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/master/kedro-training)

## Where can I find more `kedro-examples`?
