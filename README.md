# What is `kedro-examples`?

This repo contains links to all official and community created example Kedro projects as well as the complete version of the [spaceflights tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.html).

## What will I find in this repository?

- We recommend starting with [`kedro-tutorial`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/master/kedro-tutorial), which is the complete version of the [Space Flights tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.html) described in the Kedro [documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) and includes the data necessary to run the project. Some of the old code examples are available in the following links:

  - [Kedro 0.14.0](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.14.0)
  - [Kedro 0.15.0](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.0)
  - [Kedro 0.15.5](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.5)
  - [Kedro 0.15.8](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.15.8)
  - [Kedro 0.16.1](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.16.1)
  - [Kedro 0.16.4](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples/tree/example/0.16.4)


## Where can I find more learning material and `kedro-examples`?

The [`Kedro-Training`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-training) repository contains documentation that you can use to deliver Kedro training.

These repositories contain the official Kedro tutorial projects, also known as starters:
- [Spaceflights tutorial](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-starter-spaceflights)
- [Iris dataset tutorial with pandas](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-starter-pandas-iris)
- [Iris dataset tutorial with pyspark](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-starter-pyspark-iris)

Our community of Kedro users are creating their own profile projects, you can have a look at:

- [Response Recommendation System for BarefootLaw](https://github.com/dssg/barefoot-winnie-public) by Kasun Amarasinghe, Carlos Caro, Nupoor Gandhi and Raphaelle Roffo, an extensive Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) at Imperial College London project that recommends responses to law related queries
- [Augury](https://github.com/tipresias/augury) by [Craig Franklin](https://github.com/cfranklin11), machine-learning functionality for predicting AFL match results in the Tipresias app
- [CausalLift](https://github.com/Minyus/causallift) by [Yusuke Minami](https://github.com/Minyus), a Python package for Uplift Modeling in real-world business
- [PipelineX](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex) by [Yusuke Minami](https://github.com/Minyus), a Python package to develop pipelines for rapid Machine/Deep Learning experimentation using Kedro and MLflow. Example projects using PyTorch, Pandas, and OpenCV are available.
- [kedro-mlflow-example](https://github.com/tgoldenberg/kedro-mlflow-example) by [Tom Goldenberg](https://github.com/tgoldenberg), a project that demonstrates how to integrate MLflow with a Kedro codebase
